# Question 1
## Library Information System 
### Functional Requirements
* **Simplicity**: The system should extend the loan spell and make it simple for customers to borrow and return books.
* **Concurrency**: The system should be able to handle concurrent bookings and possible booking clashes.
* **User Authentication**: Before granting access to or returning a book to any user, authentication is required. This confirms whether or not the user is an LTS member.
* **Flexibility**: Allow users to extend the due date for book returns if there are no upcoming reservations.
* **Web Application**: A web application's ultimate product should meet the needs of both students and employees.
* **Admin Previlages**: Give the librarian administrative rights so that they can modify the system's records and have complete control over it.

### The non-functional requirements are as follows:

* **UI/UX**: The user should enjoy the look and feel of the web application, which includes the way the screen is structured, the buttons, and the text.
* **Security**: There should be no requests from outside the Institute LAN served by the web application, which should only operate inside the Institute LAN. End-to-end encryption and not storing passwords in plain text are two further security measures that can be applied.
* **Scalability**: Our application needs to be able to respond quickly to user queries even if they suddenly increase.
* **Remainders/Alerts**: Depending on the user's borrowing deadline, the system should to send reminders to the user to return the book or request an extension of the loan.
* **Quuck Responses**: A large number of requests should be handled by the LIS web application, and responses should be sent in under five seconds.
* **24/7 Availability**: There shouldn't be any downtime during business hours for the online application.
* **Latest Technology**: Recent HTML 5 should be used for the app.
* **Two-factor Authentication**: By confirming LIS users by sending a confirmation email and an OTP to their mobile numbers, advanced authentication methods like two-factor authentication can be implemented.
* **Compatibility**: All browsers should have native support, it should be noted.

***Portability, risk, authentication, performance, etc,*** are some of the other non-functional requirements.

# Question 2

## Mobile Hearing Aid System

### Scope
* For the almost 5% of the world's population who have severe hearing impairments, a mobile application should be created. When immediate action is required, such as when oncoming cars are crossing the street or when someone is pleading for aid, this app will notify the user. The software will be able to use AI to recognise common noises in particular contexts, like a car horn.
### Features
* **Alerts/Notification**: The app should notify the user as soon as it anticipates a warning message.
* **Feedback**: To ensure that the user was informed of the warning notification, user input must be obtained.
* **AI**: This mobile app should use artificial intelligence to detect noises.
* **Multiple Alert Types**: Provide consumers with a selection of alert types, such as sound, vibration, visual, and flash, so they may select the combination that best suits their needs.
* **Battery Efficient**: Both battery usage and delay should be kept to a minimum for the app.
* **Location-based alerts**: based on the user's location, sends notifications when they enter or leave a certain area.
* **Emergency alerts**: enables users to configure emergency alerts for crucial notifications, like weather warnings, natural disasters, and other crucial alerts.


### Non-Functional Requirements
* **User-friendly interface**: System should have an intuitive and accessible user interface for users to easily manage their notification settings.
* **App compatibility**: To ensure that the majority of users can use this app, it is compatible with a variety of popular android and iOS versions.
* **Security**: Every user's sensitive information should be protected, and data privacy must be maintained.


***Portability, risk, authentication, performance, etc,*** are some of the other non-functional requirements.
